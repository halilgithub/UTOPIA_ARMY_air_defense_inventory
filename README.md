# UTOPIA_ARMY_air_defense_inventory
I am developing an Air Defense Inventory System for the Army of UTOPIA (an imaginary country) using C++.

## introduction and status
It is an ongoing Project yet. It will track the whole Air Defense Inventory (weapons, radars and other systems).
I haven't decided yet whether I will use a database. files or any data structure (e.g. std::vector). I will first implement
as a console application and may finalize it with a Qt User Interface.
My main porpose is to develop a clean proffesional application following OOP Principles, common C++ standards and convensions.
