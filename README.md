# UTOPIA_ARMY_air_defense_inventory
I am developing an Air Defense Inventory System for the Army of UTOPIA (an imaginary country) using C++.

## introduction and status
It is an ongoing Project yet. It will track the whole Air Defense Inventory of utopia army(weapons, radars and other systems).
I haven't decided yet whether I will use a database or any other structure. I will first implement it
as a console application and may finalize it with a Qt User Interface.
My main purpose is to develop a clean professional application following Object-Oriented Analysis&Design principles, common C++ standards and convensions.
